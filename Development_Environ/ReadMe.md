Initially for couple of days, I worked with cloudera image on one of the virtual machines. This is the fastest way to be up and running - all components of the ecosystem come bundled in the image.

The trial period for the virtual machine ran out quickly though. Also, I wanted to get a feel of installing the software. Hence decided to download and install on my own.

Started with installing just Hadoop on Mac.

Hadoop Install on mac :

There are many good links on the Web, providing guidelines on the installation steps. 
I followed this one -> http://amodernstory.com/2014/09/23/installing-hadoop-on-mac-osx-yosemite/

I also downloaded the source code for 2.6.0 Hadoop - handy when one wants to read code to understand better
