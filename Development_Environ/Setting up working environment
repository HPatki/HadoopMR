Initially for couple of days worked with cloudera image on one of the virtual machines. This is the fastest way to be up and running.The trial period for the virtual machine ran out quickly. Also, wanted to get a feel of installing the software. Hence decided to download and install on my own.

Hadoop Install on mac -> There are many good links on the Web, providing guidelines on the installation steps. 

I followed this one -> http://amodernstory.com/2014/09/23/installing-hadoop-on-mac-osx-yosemite/

I also downloaded the source code for 2.6.0 Hadoop - handy when one wants to read code to understand better
