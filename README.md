Example for getting to know Hadoop Mapreduce and its components

# Brief

When i started learning Hadoop, specifically the map reduce, all or most of the examples that I came across were around word counting. I wanted to try something more than just the basic. Hence decided to try and write a map reduce program to aggregate data based on multiple Fields of a record.
