Log of activities while i continue to learn Hadoop, Mapreduce and its ecosystems

# Brief

When i started learning Hadoop, specifically the map reduce, all or most of the examples that I came across were around word counting. I wanted to try something more than just the basic. Hence decided to write a map reduce program to aggregate data based on multiple Fields of a record. 

As i started writing that program, i got more questions about the framework. That is when i decided to capture my experience here on gitHub in anticipation that it helps others as well as myself when i look back on the process of learning.
