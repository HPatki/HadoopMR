I wanted to understand the workings of InputFormat and RecordReader classes in little bit more detail. Decided to implement a Custom InputFormat and RecordReader for that purpose.

The source files are pretty self explanatory and straight forward to understand.

While trying out the implementation, ran into issues. These issues helped me gain understanding of the internal workings of Hadoop framework. In my experience, experimenting and trying out stuff on own always leads to better knowledge. The more issues one faces while trying out stuff, the better (learning) !!
